3.00  Removed C code.
      Updated -pad option to close()

2.09  Added returnPropattr and returnPropvalue methods per request from
      Luca Reni
      Worked a little more on POD

2.08  use smaller epsilon
      handle dt and tt in GDT format

2.07  POD help for returnXyAsArray() incomplete (did not mention -xyInt option
      which should be the most common mode for modifying GDS2)
      Examples/gdsdump2gds updated to make use of printUnits() and handle
      units/dbunits other than 0.001/1e-9

2.06  Improved readGds2RecordHeader() and related methods per request from
      Vitor Antunes

2.05  Added -uUnit and -dbUnit options to printInitLib() and printUnits()
      methods per request from Wolfgang Hoppe

2.04  Added dataSize(). Added method returnUnitsAsArray() method written
      by Toby Schaffer. Thanks Toby!

2.03  Updated GDS2.pm as well as gds2dump and dumpgds2gds example
      programs to handle GDT (Graphic Data Text format).
      Trying out Makefile.PL kludge to make CPAN happy.

2.02  Fix to C code: CurrentDataList was not being saved correctly.
      Changed C comments to use "/* */" instead of "//" for those compilers
      that may not grok '//'

2.01  Added install option of Inline::C for reading.
      Standardized all UNITS string printing of 1e-9, 1e-09, 1e-009 etc... to 1e-9

1.32  Start to use Build instead of make.
      Took Inline::C version and stripped out C code. Some minor changes
      which gave a welcome speed increase.

1.3.1 Minor mod. Added returnBgnextn() returnEndextn() some defines.
      Fixed posAngle() so it doesn't round angles (Thanks Martin for
      pointing out the problem).

1.3.0 Fix to printText() ... typo fix "-x" to "-y"

1.2.9 Fix to printBoundary() when array of reals is used

1.2.8 Added returnDatatype and returnTexttype used in Examples/gdslayers

1.2.7 Added tellSize() which allowed me to create a progress bar for the
      cute Examples/gds2dumptk program. Added a -pad => # option to close
      method which pads end of file with nulls (some systems like this).
      Use file handle close method instead of standard Perl close at the
      suggestion of John Reynolds.

1.2.6 Cygwin Perl was printing out "1.e-9" others "1e-9" for UNITS updated
      to strip unneeded "."

1.2.5 a better BIT_ARRAY solution for little-endian machines.

1.2.4 Added modgds2 to Examples/ and fixed a BIT_ARRAY problem for
      little-endian machines. (DO NOT USE)

1.2.3 Turned on use warnings line which requires 5.6 perl

1.2.2 Added:
      returnSname() -  return string if record type is SNAME else ''
      returnXyAsArray() - returns current (read) XY record as an array
      returnRecordAsPerl() - returns current (read) record as a perl command
          to facilitate the creation of parameterized gds2 data with perl.
      ReturnRecordAsPerl was contributed by Peter Baumbach. Thanks Peter!

1.2.1 Put option -isoDate in to print years as 2001 instead of 101
      since the GDS2 spec doesn't seem to care and supports an integer
      up to 65535. Added experimental option -markEnd to close() for
      David Kao to try. Fixed -width option to printPath() and added
      -unitWidth option for backwards compatibility.

1.2.0 Added a bunch of constants. Starting to look at speed-ups. Write
      year out as years since 1900 since Cadence pipo has problems with
      ISO type date (2001 v.s. 101)

1.1.1 Started adding tests. Needed to make a change to little-endian
      record read.

1.1   Should be set for little endian machines. Starting to look
      for speed improvements.

1.0   Originally developed on big endian machines, I still have some
      work to do on the write methods for little endian machines.
